# ðŸŒŸ UniSwap Currency - New Friendly Experience

## How the New System Works

### 1. **Welcome Experience**
- Every new chat starts with a warm welcome message
- No immediate parameter collection
- Friendly introduction to capabilities

### 2. **Smart Trading Mode Activation**
The bot only asks for trading parameters when you mention:
- "smart stop orders"
- "stop order" / "stop orders"
- "set up trade" / "setup trade"
- "trading parameters"
- "sell order" / "buy order"
- "limit order"
- "threshold"
- "automatic trade" / "auto trade"
- "when price reaches"
- "alert me when"
- "notify when"

### 3. **Gemini-Powered Friendly Messages**
Instead of boring parameter lists, the bot now uses Gemini AI to create:
- Warm, conversational responses
- Natural question flow
- Engaging, helpful tone
- Beautiful formatting
